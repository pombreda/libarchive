#summary Ideas that would be nice to implement someday.

<wiki:toc>

= ZIsoFS support =

See Issue 2 for details.

= Extended Attribute interoperability =

libarchive's handling of POSIX.1e-style extended attributes
in pax files should be interoperable across systems,
but there has not been a lot of testing of this.
There also needs to be some work to implement the system-dependent
portions for more operating systems.  (Currently, only Linux and
FreeBSD are fully supported; it should be easy to add Mac OS and
Solaris and possibly others.)

= Pax front-end =

It should be feasible to build a POSIX-compliant pax on top of libarchive.

= Sparse archiving =

FreeBSD now has `seek(HOLE)` support that should make it possible
to efficiently archive sparse files.
This will require adding a new archive_entry field to store the
list of segments and modifications to archive_read_disk and
the pax writer.

= Stackable write filters =

The write filters should be restructured so that you
can have multiple write filters.
We can then separate out the blocking into a separate
filter and eliminate blocking issues from all of the
compression filters.
This would also enable some new write capabilities that
I'm very interested in.

= UUencode/decode filters =

On the write side, this requires stackable write filters first.
On the read side, this should be quite routine.

= Encrypted backup support =

This requires stackable write filters first.
I have a rough design of how to implement this; ask for details.

= Exploiting seekable input =

This requires a little care, but ISO and Zip readers could really
benefit from seeking when the input supports it.
I insist that we maintain the ability to read most ISO and Zip
files even when seek is unavailable.

= Seek in archives =

A few people have asked for the ability to efficiently
"re-read" particular archive entries.
This is a tricky subject.
For many formats, the performance gains from this would
be very modest.
For example, after the item above is implemented, re-reading
a Zip archive from the beginning will be very fast since
it would only involve re-parsing the central directory.
The cases where there would be real gains (e.g., tar.gz)
are going to be very difficult to handle.
The most likely implementation would be some form of checkpointing
so that clients can explicitly ask for a checkpoint object and then
restore back to that checkpoint.
The checkpoint object could be complex if you have a series of
stacked read filters plus state in the format handler itself.

= MMap and async I/O performance experiments =

It should be possible to read archives using mmap()
or async I/O and it might be significantly faster than
the current approach.
However, this requires some careful performance testing
before we can be confident that it really is an improvement.
(If it doesn't help performance, we shouldn't do it.)

Similar improvements when writing archives are feasible,
though there are a few issues in the current write blocking that
make this harder than it sounds.
(The stackable write filter project above would
help; that would at least consolidate blocking into
fewer places.)

= ISO writer =

ISO writing is tricky because all metadata precedes all file data.
I've figured out a couple of easy workarounds, though, so I think this
is manageable.
The hardest part will be implementing this in a way that avoids the
need to have a lot of options.  The `mkisofs` utility already does
a good job of providing lots of options for people who need specific
control over how their ISO images are created; I'd like for libarchive
to provide a solid, easy-to-use answer for the 99% of the time
that people just need an ISO image that works.
(I envision that libarchive's ISO writer would generate Joliet
and Rockridge extensions and would provide a very few
options for creating bootable CDs.)

= Mac "!CopyFile()" support =

It would be nice for bsdtar to be compatible with Apple's
modified GNU tar implementation.

= xar reader and writer =

Xar should be relatively straightforward to read.
Writing will require tricks similar to the ISO writer.

= BSD-style long filename support for GNU ld =

The GNU/SysV ar format is ugly to write because you need to collect a filename table in advance.
This complicates programs that write ar format.
The BSD ar format avoids this problem but GNU ld doesn't support it.
If GNU ld could read the BSD ar format, then it would be easier
to create library-management tools on top of libarchive.
