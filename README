README for libtransform bundle.

Questions?  Issues?
   * http://libtransform.googlecode.com/ is the home for ongoing
     libtransform development, including issue tracker, additional
     documentation, and links to the libtransform mailing lists.

This distribution bundle includes the following components:
   * libtransform: a library for reading and writing streaming transforms
   * tar: the 'bsdtar' program is a full-featured 'tar'
          replacement built on libtransform
   * cpio: the 'bsdcpio' program is a different interface to
          essentially the same functionality
   * examples: Some small example programs that you may find useful.
   * examples/minitar: a compact sample demonstrating use of libtransform.
          I use this for testing link pollution; it should produce a very
          small executable file on most systems.
   * contrib:  Various items sent to me by third parties;
          please contact the authors with any questions.

The top-level directory contains the following information files:
   * NEWS - highlights of recent changes
   * COPYING - what you can do with this
   * INSTALL - installation instructions
   * README - this file
   * configure - configuration script, see INSTALL for details.
   * CMakeLists.txt - input for "cmake" build tool, see INSTALL

The following files in the top-level directory are used by the
'configure' script:
   * Makefile.am, aclocal.m4, configure.ac
       - used to build this distribution, only needed by maintainers
   * Makefile.in, config.h.in
	- templates used by configure script

Guide to Documentation installed by this system:
 * bsdtar.1 explains the use of the bsdtar program
 * bsdcpio.1 explains the use of the bsdcpio program
 * libtransform.3 gives an overview of the library as a whole
 * transform_read.3, transform_write.3, transform_write_disk.3, and
   transform_read_disk.3 provide detailed calling sequences for the read
   and write APIs
 * transform_entry.3 details the "struct transform_entry" utility class
 * transform_internals.3 provides some insight into libtransform's
   internal structure and operation.
 * libtransform-formats.5 documents the file formats supported by the library
 * cpio.5, mtree.5, and tar.5 provide detailed information about these
   popular transform formats, including hard-to-find details about
   modern cpio and tar variants.
The manual pages above are provided in the 'doc' directory in
a number of different formats.

You should also read the copious comments in "transform.h" and the
source code for the sample programs for more details.  Please let me
know about any errors or omissions you find.

Currently, the library automatically detects and reads the following:
  * gzip compression
  * bzip2 compression
  * compress/LZW compression
  * lzma and xz compression
  * GNU tar format (including GNU long filenames, long link names, and
    sparse files)
  * Solaris 9 extended tar format (including ACLs)
  * Old V7 tar transforms
  * POSIX ustar
  * POSIX pax interchange format
  * POSIX octet-oriented cpio
  * SVR4 ASCII cpio
  * POSIX octet-oriented cpio
  * Binary cpio (big-endian or little-endian)
  * ISO9660 CD-ROM images (with optional Rockridge or Joliet extensions)
  * ZIP transforms (with uncompressed or "deflate" compressed entries)
  * GNU and BSD 'ar' transforms
  * 'mtree' format

The library can write:
  * gzip compression
  * bzip2 compression
  * compress/LZW compression
  * lzma and xz compression
  * POSIX ustar
  * POSIX pax interchange format
  * "restricted" pax format, which will create ustar transforms except for
    entries that require pax extensions (for long filenames, ACLs, etc).
  * POSIX octet-oriented cpio
  * SVR4 "newc" cpio
  * shar transforms
  * ZIP transforms (with uncompressed or "deflate" compressed entries)
  * GNU and BSD 'ar' transforms
  * 'mtree' format

Notes about the library architecture:

 * This is a heavily stream-oriented system.  There is no direct
   support for in-place modification or random access.

 * The library is designed to be extended with new compression and
   transform formats.  The only requirement is that the format be
   readable or writable as a stream and that each transform entry be
   independent.  There are articles on the libtransform Wiki explaining
   how to extend libtransform.

 * On read, compression and format are always detected automatically.

 * I've attempted to minimize static link pollution.  If you don't
   explicitly invoke a particular feature (such as support for a
   particular compression or format), it won't get pulled in.
   In particular, if you don't explicitly enable a particular
   compression or decompression support, you won't need to link
   against the corresponding compression or decompression libraries.
   This also reduces the size of statically-linked binaries in
   environments where that matters.

 * On read, the library accepts whatever blocks you hand it.
   Your read callback is free to pass the library a byte at a time
   or mmap the entire transform and give it to the library at once.
   On write, the library always produces correctly-blocked output.

 * The object-style approach allows you to have multiple transform streams
   open at once.  bsdtar uses this in its "@transform" extension.

 * The transform itself is read/written using callback functions.
   You can read an transform directly from an in-memory buffer or
   write it to a socket, if you wish.  There are some utility
   functions to provide easy-to-use "open file," etc, capabilities.

 * The read/write APIs are designed to allow individual entries
   to be read or written to any data source:  You can create
   a block of data in memory and add it to a tar transform without
   first writing a temporary file.  You can also read an entry from
   an transform and write the data directly to a socket.  If you want
   to read/write entries to disk, there are convenience functions to
   make this especially easy.

 * Note: "pax interchange format" is really an extended tar format,
   despite what the name says.
