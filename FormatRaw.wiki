#summary Libarchive's "raw" reader.

= Introduction =

Libarchive's automatic decompression and decoding support is sometimes useful by itself.

For this reason, libarchive provides a special dearchiving module called "raw" which returns a single fake entry; the data for that entry is the decoded data stream.
This provides a way to use libarchive's automatic decompression and decoding 

(Note:  There has been some discussion of splitting libarchive into two separate libraries.  "Libfilter" would expose just the decompression and decoding support, and "libarchive" would then become a user of "libfilter."  Initial work has been done but the project is currently looking for people to help complete it.)

== Caveat: Don't mix _raw_ with other handlers ==

If you are using the raw handler, you should generally not enable any other handler (except possibly for the [FormatEmpty empty handler]).

Many of the formats supported by libarchive were not designed with automatic format detection in mind.
Although libarchive generally does a very good job of distinguishing different archive formats, mixing non-archive files can produce surprising results.
As a result, the raw handler will often lose the bid because a file happens to have a pattern of bytes similar to that of one of the supported archive formats.

In particular, the raw handler is not enabled by `archive_read_support_format_all`.
