#summary How to get a tar if you don't already have one.

The instructions for building libarchive assume you
already have a tar program with which to extract the
libarchive distribution.

If you're downloading the libarchive distribution in order
to obtain a tar program, this could be a problem.

= Untar =

I've created "untar" as an extremely minimal C
program that knows just enough about the tar format
to extract the libarchive distribution.

You can obtain the source for untar from:

http://libarchive.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/contrib/untar.c

The "untar" program is written using only Standard ISO C89
(with one exception explained below).  As such,
it should compile easily on any platform with a C compiler:
 * `cc -o untar untar.c`

That one exception is the `mkdir()` function for creating
a directory.  Unfortunately, ISO C does not provide a standard
function for creating a directory, so I've used the POSIX.1
standard `mkdir()` function.  Most platforms have `mkdir()`,
though you may need to adjust the headers somewhat.  If your
platform does not have `mkdir()`, you may need to edit the
`create_dir` function to create a directory in some other way.
