#summary How to get a tar if you don't already have one.

The instructions for building libarchive assume you
already have a tar program with which to extract the
libarchive distribution.

If you're trying to use libarchive to create a tar program,
this could be a problem.

= Untar =

I've created "untar" as an extremely minimal C
program that knows just enough about the tar format
to extract the libarchive distribution.

You can obtain the source for untar from:

http://libarchive.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/contrib/untar.c

The "untar" program is written using only Standard ISO C89
(with one exception I'll explain in a moment).  As such,
it should compile easily on any platform with a C compiler.

That one exception is the `mkdir()` function for creating
a directory.  If your platform does not have `mkdir()`,
you may need to edit the `create_dir` function to create
a directory in some other way.
