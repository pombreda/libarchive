#summary How to compile and install libarchive, bsdtar, and bsdcpio from source code.

= Using _configure_ (for Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and other Unix-like systems) =

The libarchive distribution includes a standard
autoconf-generated "configure" script that should
build and install libarchive, bsdtar, and bsdcpio
on almost any POSIX-like system.

Typical installation:
 # `tar xzf libarchive-2.6.1.tar.gz`
 # `cd libarchive-2.6.1`
 # `./configure`
 # `make`
 # `make check`
 # `make install`

== Configure options ==

By default, the configure-based build will build
the libarchive library and bsdtar command-line tool.
It will install these into standard default locations.
The configure program will attempt to automatically
locate all other libraries and tools required.

You can modify this by providing additional options
to the `configure` program:
 * `./configure --help`  -- Lists all available options
 * `./configre --disable-bsdtar`  -- Suppresses build and install of bsdtar
 * `./configure --enable-bsdcpio` -- Enables build and install of bsdcpio

= Using _cmake_ (for most everything else) =

*Starting with libarchive 2.7*, there is a cmake-based
build system that can generate configuration files for
a variety of IDEs, including
Visual Studio on Windows and XCode on Mac OS.

== General usage ==

This build system uses the _cmake_ tool to generate
appropriate solution, project, or Makefiles for your
system.

You will first need to obtain and install the appropriate
version of the cmake tool for your platform.
If your favorite package manager doesn't have a version
already configured for your platform, you should check
http://cmake.org/

When you run the cmake tool, you need to provide two
pieces of information:
* The "generator" appropriate for the IDE you're using.
* The directory containing the unpacked libarchive sources.  This is the directory containing the `CMakeLists.txt` file.
