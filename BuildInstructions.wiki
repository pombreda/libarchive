#summary How to compile and install libarchive, bsdtar, and bsdcpio from source code.

= For most POSIX-like systems =

The libarchive distribution includes a standard
autoconf-generated "configure" script that should
build and install libarchive, bsdtar, and bsdcpio
on almost any POSIX-like system.

Typical installation:
 # `tar xzf libarchive-2.6.1.tar.gz`
 # `cd libarchive-2.6.1`
 # `./configure`
 # `make`
 # `make check`
 # `make install`

== Configure options ==

By default, the configure-based build will build
the libarchive library and bsdtar command-line tool.
It will install these into standard default locations.
The configure program will attempt to automatically
locate all other libraries and tools required.

You can modify this by providing additional options
to the `configure` program:
 * `./configure --help`  -- Lists all available options
 * `./configre --disable-bsdtar`  -- Suppresses build and install of bsdtar
 * `./configure --enable-bsdcpio` -- Enables build and install of bsdcpio

= For most everything else =

*Starting with libarchive 2.7*, there is a cmake-based
build system that supports a variety of IDEs, including
Visual Studio on Windows and XCode on Mac OS.

You will first need to obtain and install the appropriate
version of the cmake tool for your platform.
If your favorite package manager doesn't have a version
already configured for your platform, you should check
