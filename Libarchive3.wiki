#summary Transitioning to libarchive 3.0.

= Introduction =

Libarchive 3.0 should be available sometime in mid-2010.
For most users, the transition from libarchive 2.x should be nearly invisible.
It should require few if any changes to ensure that your code can compile against either libarchive 2.8 or libarchive 3.0.

The libarchive 3.0 release will also be deprecating some older functionality.
This functionality will not be completely removed until libarchive 4.0, which should provide a transition window of at least two full years.

= Functions that are being removed in libarchive 3.0 =

In all cases, the new function has been available for some time.
If you are still using any of the old functions listed here, you should have already switched to the newer version.

|| *Old function*            || *Function to use instead* ||
|| archive_version()         || archive_version_string()  ||
|| archive_version_stamp()   || archive_version_number()  ||
|| archive_api_version()     || archive_version_number()  ||
|| archive_feature_version() || archive_version_number()  ||

= Functions with argument changes =

These changes will break binary compatibility; the libarchive 3.0 distribution will have a new shared library version to reflect these changes.
These changes should not affect source compatibility unless you are building with a compiler that warns about integer narrowing.
Most of these changes involve the use of portable wide types such as `int64_t` instead of less-portable types such as `off_t`, `gid_t`, `uid_t`, and `ino_t`.

|| *Function name*                             ||
|| archive_entry_ino()                         ||
|| archive_entry_set_ino()                     ||

= Functions that are being renamed =

The old function name will continue to be supported until libarchive 4.0
is released, at which point the old name will be removed.
This should provide libarchive users with a transition window of at least two full years.

The new functions often have slightly different functionality.
In particular, the `write_add_filter` functions extend the write pipeline with a new filter, whereas the old `write_set_compression` functions replaced any existing filter.

|| *Old function*                           || *New name*                          ||
|| archive_read_finish()                    || archive_read_free()                 ||
|| archive_write_finish()                   || archive_write_free()                ||
|| archive_write_set_compression_bzip2()    || archive_write_add_filter_bzip2()    ||
|| archive_write_set_compression_compress() || archive_write_add_filter_compress() ||
|| archive_write_set_compression_gzip()     || archive_write_add_filter_gzip()     ||
|| archive_write_set_compression_lzma()     || archive_write_add_filter_lzma()     ||
|| archive_write_set_compression_xz()       || archive_write_add_filter_xz()       ||
