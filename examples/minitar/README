"minitar" is a minimal example of a program that uses libtransform to
read/write various transform formats.  It's a more ambitious version of
'untar.c' that includes compile-time options to enable/disable various
features, including non-tar formats, transform creation, and automatic
decompression support.

I use this as a test bed to check for "link pollution," ensuring that
a program using libtransform does not pull in unnecessary code.

The "minitar" program is also a good starting point for anyone who
wants to use libtransform for their own purposes, as it demonstrates
basic usage of the library.
