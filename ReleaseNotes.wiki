#summary Release notes for past and future libarchive versions.

_Future release: Expected late 2009_

Major version number bumps indicate backwards-incompatible API changes.
There are a handful of small API changes that I'd like to make but I do try hard to break the API as infrequently as possible.
The changes planned for libarchive 3.0 should improve libarchive's behavior on Windows and Linux:
  * Replace off_t with int64_t everywhere.  Linux has two different off_t definitions, which gets very confusing.  Windows only has 32-bit off_t, which is pretty limiting.  Switching to int64_t will ensure consistent 64-bit file size handling on all platforms.
  * Linux support for stat32 and stat64 structures.  The preprocessor headaches here seem unavoidable.
  * Eliminate dev/ino pairs from the public API.  Windows doesn't deal gracefully with this.  I think the few uses of this can be rephrased in terms of open file handles (the core requirement for "skip file" support is the ability to determine whether a file name and an open file descriptor refer to the same file).

_Future release: Expected April 2008_

The following are expected, but not yet implemented.  They may be pushed to a later release.
 * Support for concatenated gzip streams.
 * NFSv4 ACL support
 * Complete extended attribute support for FreeBSD

The following features have been implemented.  It is still possible they will get pushed to a later release.

 * Stackable read filter support.
 * Much improved Windows support, thanks largely to Michihiro NAKAJIMA.

= Libarchive 2.6 =

_Released December, 2008_

 * LZMA read support
 * New command-line parser provides uniform long-option support on all platforms
 * Birthtime support
 * archive_entry now tracks which values have been set.  In particular, this fixes a problem with extracting from zip archives that don't provide the file size in advance.  The restore-to-disk code now enforces file sizes only if a file size was specified.
 * Many small improvements to UTF8 and unicode handling.
 * mtree and shar performance improvements

Libarchive 2.0 fixed a couple of early API gaffes but mostly it introduced a regression suite that has helped immensely to improve stability.
