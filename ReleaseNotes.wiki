#summary Release notes for past and future libarchive versions.

_Future release: Expected late 2009_

Major version number bumps indicate backwards-incompatible API changes.
There are a handful of API changes that I'd like to make but I do try hard to break the API as infrequently as possible, so I'm deferring these until there's enough here to justify the pain:
  * Replace off_t with int64_t everywhere.  Linux has two different off_t definitions, which gets very confusing.  Windows only has 32-bit off_t, which is pretty limiting.  Switching to int64_t will ensure consistent 64-bit file size handling on all platforms.
  * Linux support for both stat32 and stat64.  The preprocessor headaches here seem unavoidable.
  * Eliminate dev/ino pairs from the public API.  Windows doesn't deal gracefully with this.  I think the few uses of this can be rephrased in terms of open file handles (the core requirement for "skip file" support is the ability to determine whether a file name and an open file descriptor refer to the same file).
  * Thread-safe archive_write_disk.  This requires that you "open" an archive_write_disk object by giving it a base directory and requires that we find ways to eliminate the chdir() and umask() operations from the current code.
  * Fix the awkward "options" naming conflict; archive_write_disk_options() is nothing like archive_write_options() and archive_read_options().
  * Stackable write filters.  The stackable read filters have made the read side a lot more straightforward.  The write side should do this as well.  This may require changing the archive_write_disk API so that blocking is handled by explicitly adding a blocking filter.

_Future release: Expected summer 2009_

The following are expected, but not yet implemented.  They may be pushed to a later release.

 * zisofs support - This should be straightforward; the zip reader already illustrates how to decompress gzipped bodies.
 * NFSv4 ACL support - I have done some research and think I have a good grasp of the requirements for this.
 * Exploit seekable input - Files support seeking and Zip and ISO both work better when this is available.  But I still want Zip and ISO to be usable when the input can't seek.
 * Zip writer - Anselm Strauss almost finished a Zip writer for Google Summer of Code 2008.  The code is good, it has a test harness, but needs a little more polish before it can be released.

= Libarchive 2.7 =

_Future release: Expected April 2009_

The libarchive 2.6.991a preview has all of the following features.
After I complete some additional testing (and fix any issues I find),
this will become the 2.7 release.

 * Support for concatenated gzip streams.
 * Stackable read filter support.
 * Much improved Windows support, thanks largely to Michihiro NAKAJIMA.  In particular, the test suites now build and run on Windows.
 * Support for building with "cmake" on a wide variety of platforms, thanks to Christian Ehrlicher and Michihiro.
 * Eliminated Yacc/Bison requirement for building by rewriting date parser in plain C.
 * Complete extended attribute support for FreeBSD, fixed extended attribute support for Linux
 * Improved support for AIX, Tru64, and GNU Hurd, thanks to Björn Jacke
 * Flexible options framework by Michihiro NAKAJIMA
 * Support for reading and writing XZ format, thanks to Per Øyvind Karlsen and Michihiro.
 * Support for reading Joliet extensions, thanks to Andreas Henriksson
 * Support for mtree hash and CRC options, thanks to Michihiro NAKAJIMA
 * Improved support for Cygwin, thanks to Charles Wilson

= Libarchive 2.6.2 =

_Released February, 2009_
 * Fixed minor build issues on Linux and Solaris
 * Fixed bsdtar adding null bytes to shar archive output
 * Fixed crash when clients don't register skip callback

= Libarchive 2.6.1 =

_Released January, 2009_
 * Fixed Issue 1: archive.h doesn't export required definitions
 * Fixed Issue 3: Some empty entries in .zip files not extracted correctly
 * Fixed multiple substitutions in bsdtar -s
 * Fix an occasional failure extracting gzip-compressed archives
 * Fix minor build problems on Cygwin and a few other platforms

= Libarchive 2.6 =

_Released December, 2008_

 * LZMA read support, thanks to Miklos Vajna
 * Windows build improvements, thanks to Ivailo Petrov, Kees Zeelenberg, and Vishant Singh
 * New command-line parser provides uniform long-option support on all platforms
 * Birthtime support, thanks to Pedro Giffuni
 * archive_entry now tracks which values have been set.  In particular, this fixes a problem with extracting from zip archives that don't provide the file size in advance.  The restore-to-disk code now enforces file sizes only if a file size was specified.
 * Many small improvements to UTF8 and unicode handling.
 * mtree and shar performance improvements, thanks to Joerg Sonnenberger

Libarchive 2.0 fixed a couple of early API gaffes but mostly it introduced a regression suite that has helped immensely to improve stability.
