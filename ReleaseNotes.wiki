#summary Release notes for past and future libarchive versions.

= Libarchive 3.0 =

_Future release: Expected late 2009_

Major version number bumps indicate backwards-incompatible API changes.
There are a handful of small API changes that I'd like to make but I do try hard to break the API as infrequently as possible.
The changes planned for libarchive 3.0 should improve libarchive's behavior on Windows and Linux:
  * Replace off_t with int64_t everywhere.  Linux has two different off_t definitions, which gets very confusing.  Windows only has 32-bit off_t, which is pretty limiting.  Switching to int64_t will ensure consistent 64-bit file size handling on all platforms.
  * Linux support for stat32 and stat64 structures.  The preprocessor headaches here seem unavoidable.
  * Eliminate dev/ino pairs from the public API.  Windows doesn't deal gracefully with this.  I think the few uses of this can be rephrased in terms of open file handles (the core requirement for "skip file" support is the ability to determine whether a file name and an open file descriptor refer to the same file).

_Future release: Expected April 2009_

The following are expected, but not yet implemented.  They may be pushed to a later release.

 * NFSv4 ACL support - I have done some research but it's looking less likely that I'll find time to implement this.

The following features have been implemented.  It is still possible they will get pushed to a later release.

 * Support for concatenated gzip streams.
 * Stackable read filter support.
 * Much improved Windows support, thanks largely to Michihiro NAKAJIMA.  In particular, libarchive_test and bsdtar_test now build and run on Windows.
 * Support for building with "cmake" on a wide variety of platforms, thanks to Christian Ehrlicher and Michihiro.
 * Eliminated Yacc/Bison requirement for building by rewriting date parser in plain C.
 * Complete extended attribute support for FreeBSD, fixed extended attribute support for Linux
 * Improved support for AIX and Tru64, thanks to Björn Jacke
 * Flexible options framework by Michihiro NAKAJIMA
 * Support for reading and writing XZ format, thanks to Per Øyvind Karlsen and Michihiro.
 * Support for reading Joliet extensions, thanks to Andreas Henriksson

= Libarchive 2.6.2 =

_Released February, 2009_
 * Fixed minor build issues on Linux and Solaris
 * Fixed bsdtar adding null bytes to shar archive output
 * Fixed crash when clients don't register skip callback

= Libarchive 2.6.1 =

_Released January, 2009_
 * Fixed Issue 1: archive.h doesn't export required definitions
 * Fixed Issue 3: Some empty entries in .zip files not extracted correctly
 * Fixed multiple substitutions in bsdtar -s
 * Fix an occasional failure extracting gzip-compressed archives
 * Fix minor build problems on Cygwin and a few other platforms

= Libarchive 2.6 =

_Released December, 2008_

 * LZMA read support, thanks to Miklos Vajna
 * Windows build improvements, thanks to Ivailo Petrov, Kees Zeelenberg, and Vishant Singh
 * New command-line parser provides uniform long-option support on all platforms
 * Birthtime support, thanks to Pedro Giffuni
 * archive_entry now tracks which values have been set.  In particular, this fixes a problem with extracting from zip archives that don't provide the file size in advance.  The restore-to-disk code now enforces file sizes only if a file size was specified.
 * Many small improvements to UTF8 and unicode handling.
 * mtree and shar performance improvements, thanks to Joerg Sonnenberger

Libarchive 2.0 fixed a couple of early API gaffes but mostly it introduced a regression suite that has helped immensely to improve stability.
