#summary Storing NFSv4/NTFS ACLs in tar archives.

= Introduction =

_I'm still researching this.  Contributions appreciated!_

The techniques used for storing POSIX.1e ACLs (which I'm
attempting to document in [TarPosix1eACLs] should
also be useful in storing NFSv4/NTFS ACLs.

Unfortunately, NFSv4 does not standardize a textual format
for representing ACLs.  Anyone attempting to create a portable
way to store NFSv4 ACLs is likely to need to develop a textual
format and all of the parsing routines, since OS-specific
library routines are unlikely to be useful.

I know of only one program that currently stores NFSv4 ACLs in tar archives.
Unfortunately, Apple's extensions to GNU tar do not seeem
readily applicable to other systems.

= Apple approach =

Apple stores the ACLs as an extended attribute named com.apple.acl.text in the resource file that prepends normal files in Apple-format tar archives.
(See [TarExtendedAttributes] for my attempt to document this.)

I've not yet found documentation for the textual format used here, but it seems to use a large number of colon-separated fields for each entry:
 * type
 * 128-bit GUID (of the user or group?)
 * User/group name
 * User/group ID
 * XXX document these ??? XXXX
