#summary Storing NFSv4/NTFS ACLs in tar archives.
#labels tar,format

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

I have two goals for this page:  First, I want to
develop an understanding of prior art for archiving
NFSv4/NTFS ACLs.  With that in hand, I want to decide
on an approach to implement in libarchive.  Obviously,
it is possible for libarchive to read multiple formats,
though it's unlikely that I'll write more than one format,
certainly not in the first iteration.

NFSv4 ACLs are still pretty new and the existing support
varies widely.  The open-source communities are only beginning
to seriously implement them and most Linux and BSD systems still
lack support (even when the support has been implemented, it is
usually disabled by default in shipping distributions).
Unfortunately, NFSv4 does not define a portable format
for representing ACLs.  Anyone attempting to create a portable
way to store NFSv4 ACLs is likely going to have to implement
their own format, including all parsing routines,
since OS-specific library routines are unlikely to be useful.
(Even when such routines do exist, they vary too much
across platforms to support interchange.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

= Prior Art =

Of course, the existing work on supporting POSIX.1e-style
ACLs is quite relevant.
I've tried to document this at [TarPosix1eACLs].


== Apple tar ==

Apple used a patched version of GNU tar until Mac OS X 10.5 and
uses a patched version of bsdtar starting with Mac OS X 10.6.
Both of these store the ACLs as an extended attribute named com.apple.acl.text
in the associated resource file.
(See [TarExtendedAttributes] for my attempt to document the resource file storage.)

I've not yet found documentation for the textual format used here, but it seems to use a large number of colon-separated fields for each entry:
 * type
 * 128-bit user/group GUID
 * User/group name
 * User/group ID
 * XXX document these ??? XXXX

The inclusion of both a POSIX-style numeric ID and a GUID for each user and group is very interesting.  I would like for libarchive to support NFSv4/NTFS ACLs on both Windows and MacOS, at least eventually, so there will need to be some provision for extended IDs of this sort.  (Although there are complications; Windows SIDs may prove to be too machine-specific for practical interchange.)

== AIX tar ==

AIX tar stores an additional 'A' entry after the regular
file entry.  The pathname of this entry is "NFS4", the body
is a binary formatted ACL.  Björn Jacke was kind enough
to send me an example.  This is the contents of the
'A' entry body:

And this is the textual ACL from the file on disk.
The relevant UIDs in this example are build=208, obnox=209, vl=205.
The relevant GIDs in this example are system=0, lp=11, snapp=13, mail=6, and perf=20.

{{{

u:vl:           d       wpxd

s:(EVERYONE@):  a       rRac
s:(EVERYONE@):  d       wpxd
}}}

It's interesting to note that the textual format is actually significantly more compact than the binary version.
Stripping spaces from the text version above gives 280 bytes versus 456 for the binary version.
This textual format is also considerably more compact than the textual format used by Apple.
Unfortunately, neither the binary nor text formats used by AIX are suitable for archiving, since neither format provides both user/group names and IDs.

In addition, AIX tar's "A" record arrangement would be very difficult to support with libarchive, which expects all metadata to precede the file body.

== AIXC ACLs ==

Björn Jacke also sent me an example of the "AIXC" ACLs
used on AIX.
The AIXC ACLs are neither POSIX.1e nor NFSv4 compliant, of
course, but this example does shed a little light on AIX tar's handling
of NFSv4 ACLs.
In particular, AIX tar again uses an "A" entry, but this time the pathname
is "AIXC"; it appears the pathname of the "A" entry specifies the ACL type,
duplicating the first four bytes of the entry body.
Here's an sample body of such an "A" entry:

{{{
00000400  41 49 58 43 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 60 02 00 00 00  |AIXC.......`....|
00000410  00 00 00 06 00 04 00 04  00 0c 40 06 00 08 00 01  |..........@.....|
00000420  00 00 00 d0 00 14 80 04  00 08 00 01 00 00 00 d1  |................|
00000430  00 08 00 02 00 00 00 00  00 1c c0 04 00 08 00 01  |................|
00000440  00 00 00 cd 00 08 00 02  00 00 00 0b 00 08 00 02  |................|
00000450  00 00 00 06 00 14 40 06  00 08 00 02 00 00 00 0d  |......@.........|
00000460  00 08 00 02 00 00 00 14                           |........|
}}}

And here is a textual dump of the ACL from the corresponding
file on disk:

{{{
* ACL_type   AIXC
attributes:
base permissions
    owner(root):  rw-
    group(system):  r--
    others:  r--
extended permissions
    enabled
    permit   rw-     u:build
    deny     r--     u:obnox,g:system
    specify  r--     u:vl,g:lp,g:mail
    permit   rw-     g:snapp,g:perf
}}}

== Solaris tar ==

Edward Thomas Napierala sent me an example of an archive from SunOS (version?) with an NFSv4 ACL.  This seems to follow the same outline used by SunOS for POSIX.1e ACLs.  The ACL is held by an 'A' entry in the tar archive that precedes the main entry for the file.

The name of the 'A' entry matches the name of the file and the body of the 'A' entry contains an octal number, a null byte, and a textual representation of the ACL.
The octal number is 03000000 plus the number of entries in the ACL.
In Edward's example, there are 7 entries, represented as follows (the line breaks here are added only for readability, they're not in the original).

{{{
    user:bin:----------c---:------:deny:2,
    owner@:--x-----------:------:deny,
    owner@:rw-p---A-W-Co-:------:allow,
    group@:rwxp----------:------:deny,
    group@:--------------:------:allow,
    everyone@:rwxp---A-W-Co-:------:deny,
    everyone@:------a-R-c--s:------:allow
}}}

This is pretty readable, and includes the UID, but is significantly bulkier than it needs to be (the '-' characters could easily have been omitted) and doesn't have any obvious provision for user or group GUIDs.

== star? ==

The star website and manpages have a couple of
oblique references to NFSv4 ACL support, but I've
not seen any documentation or announcement of such
functionality.
(I do know Joerg Schilling was involved with OpenSolaris
work; the Solaris tar design above might be his?)

== Others? ==

If you know of other tar implementations that have
full or partial support for NFS4-style ACLs, please
let me know.

------------------------------------------------------------------

= Libarchive's implementation =

_As of June 2010, I've started work on this approach and expect the
final implementation to be pretty close to this._

== Core requirements ==

 * The ACL should be stored in a compact format.  This argues for a textual format similar to the AIX or Solaris format above.  Several OSes support some variant of this approach in their standard tools.
 * The format should be portable and platform-independent so that ACLs can be correctly transferred between platforms.
 * The ACL representation should be easy to reverse-engineer so that other tools can support the libarchive format.  This also argues for a textual representation.
 * It should be easy to store such ACLs as pax extended attributes, which heavily favors a UTF-8 representation.
 * Although pax has no such limitation, other formats may prefer a single-line format.
 * It must have both numeric IDs and names for each user or group.
 * It should provide an obvious path for adding extended GUID (MacOS) or SID (Windows) identifiers on each entry.

== Proposed design ==

I propose using the following format for storing NFSv4 ACLs in pax archives written by libarchive:
 * Store the ACL in a pax attribute named LIBARCHIVE.acl.nfs4
 * Textual format with entire ACL on one line.

Example:
{{{
   -c::u:bin:2,
   -x::o@,
   +rwpAWCo::o@,
   -rwxp::g@,
   +::g@,
   -rwxpAWCo::e@,
   +aRcs::e@
}}}
The ACL here is the same one used in the Solaris example above.
Compare these examples to better understand the proposed encoding.
Note that the whitespace and line breaks here are purely for
ease of reading.
Within the archive, it would actually be stored as a single line:
{{{
-c::u:bin:2,-x::o@,+rwpAWCo::o@,-rwxp::g@,+::g@,-rwxpAWCo::e@,+aRcs::e@
}}}

Format description:
The ACL consists of a series of ACEs separated by commas.
Each ACE has the following format:
 * Fixed fields that appear in every ACE:
   * First character is type: '+' for allow, '-' for deny, '?' for audit
   * Permission characters (following Solaris encoding)
   * Colon
   * Inheritance characters (following Solaris encoding)
   * Colon
   * Flag indicating who this applies to: 'u' for user, 'g' for group, 'o@' for owner, 'g@' for owning group, 'e@' for everyone
 * If 'u' or 'g', user information follows:
   * Colon
   * Username
   * Colon
   * Numeric user ID
   * Someday:  colon and GUID/SID

This satisfies the concerns listed earlier:
  * Textual.  Except for user/group names, everything here is 7-bit ASCII and is therefore UTF-8 compatible if the user/group names are.
  * Compact. This has no extraneous whitespace or '-' characters
  * Username is delimited by colons before and after.  (Many systems permit '.' or ',' characters in usernames.)
  * Variable fields appear at end to simplify parsing.
  * It will be easy to add an additional field for User/Group GUID if that proves useful.

== Implementation checklist ==

Implementing this requires changes to several different areas.
Fortunately, most of these are pretty minor:

 * Machine-independent
  * archive_entry needs to be able to store and produce ACLs.
   * Accept and parse a UTF-8 encoded text format.
   * Produce such a string.
   * Add an entry to the existing ACL (provided as a set of broken-down fields) (this is done)
   * Iterate over ACL entries providing broken-down fields.
  * Pax writer
   * Write a LIBARCHIVE.acl.nfs4 attribute when it exists in the entry
  * Pax reader
   * Read LIBARCHIVE.acl.nfs4 attribute
   * Read Solaris tar 'A' record (?)
 * Machine-dependent
  * archive_read_entry_from_disk()
   * FreeBSD 9
   * Linux (?)
   * Windows (?)
   * Mac OS X (?)
  * archive_write_disk()
   * FreeBSD 9 (this is done)
   * Linux (?)
   * Windows (?)
   * Mac OS X (?)

Note that with the above, bsdtar and bsdcpio will both pick up this capability for free.

== More research is needed ==

It would be nice to support NFS4 ACLs in a cpio extension.
It would be nice to be able to read NFS4-style ACLs written by Mac OS 'tar'.
